      <p>Hey, I'm Parth Batra. I'm a data scientist by profession, but a music critic by passion. I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewari" target="_blank">Rewari</a>—a small town near Delhi-NCR—and I've been navigating the world of data science for about ~3.5 years now.</p>
      <p>I kicked things off with internships at <a href="https://www.genpact.com" target="_blank">Genpact</a> (as an AI Engineer) and <a href="https://brightchamps.com/" target="_blank">Brightchamps</a> (as a Software Engineer), and now I'm happily crunching numbers and building cool stuff as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.procol.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Procol</strong></a> (check <a href="https://www.procol.ai" target="_blank">procol.ai</a>).</p>

      <p>I like to think of myself as a <strong>Full Stack Data Scientist</strong> because I've done a bit of everything:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deployed multiple data pipelines</li>
        <li>Trained and deployed ML models</li>
        <li>Created some pretty neat LLM agents</li>
        <li>Wrote SQL queries that sometimes stretch up to 600-700 lines</li>
        <li>Developed new microservices from scratch with CI/CD pipelines</li>
        <li>Built dashboards for core business metrics for smarter, data-driven decisions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I started this blog to share my thoughts—whether it's my take on the latest tech or a quirky hot take (like why I believe <em>R is better than Python for keeping code uniform</em>). It might not be perfect, but it's real talk, just like a personal logger or conversation with my imaginary friend.</p>

      <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/" target="_blank"><strong>BITS Pilani</strong></a> with a multidisciplinary degree—B.E. (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering and M.S. (Hons.) in Mathematics. And on a fun note, one of my proudest achievements is clocking over 100k minutes on Spotify Rewind in the last three years.</p>

      <p>When I'm not deep into data or coding, you can find me keeping up with POP-culture, the latest twitter dramas, or just finding new artists on spotify. Feel free to check out my <a href="/blog" target="_blank">articles</a>.</p>
